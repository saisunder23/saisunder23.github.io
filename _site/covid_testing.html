<h4>In this project, I use data to clean and plot <strong>COVID-19 Testing Locations.</strong> Using the <code>leaflet</code> package, I make these maps interactive with zoom capabilities and pop-up displays with information specific to each datapoint on the map. I also show how to cluster data points together and swap map backgrounds. These interactive maps can serve as an important resource for those seeking information regarding testing locations near them.</h4>
